## ToDo Ultimate

I made a simple todo app with Laravel Livewire Volt Class API and Folio for file based routing using MySQL database. I also used Socialite for Google registration/signup. 

- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/).
- [Laravel Livewire Volt](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/volt).
- [Laravel Folio](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/folio#main-content).
- [Laravel Socialite](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/socialite).

To run do: 

- ```composer install```
- ```npm install```
- ```php artisan key:generate```
- ```php artisan migrate```
- ```nmp run dev```
- ```php artisan serve``` in second terminal
